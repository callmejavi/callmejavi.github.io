About me
Cambridge resident since 2013. Boardgame enthusiast since 2014.
My BoardGameGeek profile
My appearances on YouTube (where I talk about boardgames, of course!)
Games I played (780 as of 25/Mar/2022)
Games I own (189 as of 25/Mar/2022)
==================================================02 Why choose me?======================================================
Why choose me?
Because I have an extensive knowledge of all kind of boardgames, having tried more than 780 different titles along the past 9 years.
Because I'm always curious and I like to try everything, from a 5-minute match of Rhino Hero to an 8-hour session of Twilight Imperium.
Because "knowing a game" is not the same as "knowing how to teach a game" and I know how to teach games effectively.
Because I'm the go-to person in my group of friends when anyone asks for recommendations based on budget, player count, length, complexity and theme.
Because I'm the go-to person in my gaming groups when anyone asks for someone to teach them a game or introduce them to new titles.
Because I can teach games in several languages.
